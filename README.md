# Naprstek-Smith-Interpolation
Interpolation method developed by Tomas Naprstek and Richard Smith.

Files tested and working with Geosoft's Oasis Montaj V9.

NOTE: Sometimes the menu will not be available in V9, I haven't figured out why yet. What seems to solve it is adding a number to the end of the .omn file. For instance, if you cannot see the menu (assuming it is in the correct location), then change the name to "NaprstekSmith1.omn".
