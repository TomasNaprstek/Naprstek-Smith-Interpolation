# Naprstek-Smith-Interpolation
Interpolation method developed by Tomas Naprstek and Richard Smith.

Files tested and working with Geosoft's Oasis Montaj V9.

NOTE: Sometimes the menu will not be available in V9, I haven't figured out why yet. What seems to solve it is adding a number to the end of the .omn file. For instance, if you cannot see the menu (assuming it is in the correct location), then change the name to "NaprstekSmith1.omn".

Custom Menu in Geosoft's Oasis Montaj:

Follow the instructions given on Geosoft’s support site for importing custom menus, using the NaprstekSmith.dll and NaprstekSmith.omn files. This will allow the creation of a new menu inside of Oasis Montaj. Once run, the plugin will output a .txt file that can be used in the “Import ASCII Grid…” option under the “Grid and Image”, “Utilities” menu. Information regarding the importing process is written at the top of the output file.
